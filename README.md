# 🚗 ML Project - Car Price Prediction  

## 🚀 Overview  
This **Machine Learning project** aims to predict the **resale price of cars** using the **Lasso Regression (Linear Regression)** model. The model analyzes various car attributes such as **Car Name, Year, Selling Price, Present Price, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, and Owner** to accurately estimate the vehicle’s market value.  

A detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations influencing car prices.  

The trained model achieved an impressive **R² score of 0.83**, indicating strong predictive performance. This project showcases how **regression techniques** can be effectively applied in **real-world automobile price prediction** and valuation scenarios.

## 🧠 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection:** Load the car dataset containing details like model, year, fuel type, and price.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing data, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical data.  
3. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Visualize trends and correlations using plots and statistical summaries.  
4. **Model Training:** Train the Lasso Regression model to predict car resale prices.  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess performance using metrics such as **R² Score** and **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**.  
6. **Prediction:** Input new car details to estimate resale price instantly.
