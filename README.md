# ML-Projects-Car-Price-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** aims to predict the **resale price of cars** using the **Lasso Regression (Linear Regression)** model. The model takes input features such as **Car Name, Year, Selling Price, Present Price, Kilometers Driven, Fuel Type, Seller Type, Transmission, and Owner** to estimate the car’s market value. A detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was performed to identify key relationships and trends affecting car prices. The trained model achieved an **R² score of 0.83**, indicating strong predictive performance. This project demonstrates how **regression techniques** can be effectively applied to real-world **automobile price prediction** problems.
